Welcome to my personal page. I will try to keep this website updated with my current projects update and other interesting news I come across.

Personnal Projects
======
I am currently in the process of making a boardgame with a dear friend inspired by Battlestar Galactica and The King's Dilemma, where players compete with each other to leave their mark in history in the troubled times of the Roman Empire.
Expect some updates as soon as a first protoype is ready to be playtested.

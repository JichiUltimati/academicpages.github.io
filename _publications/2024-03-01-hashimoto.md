In this paper we study the strict refinement property for connected partial orders also known as Hashimoto’s Theorem. This property implies that any isomorphism between products of irreducible structures is determined is uniquely determined as a product of isomorphisms between the factors. This refinement implies a sort of smallest possible decomposition for such structures. After a brief recall of the necessary notion we prove that Hashimoto’s theorem can be extended to connected loop-free categories, i.e. categories with no non-trivial morphisms endomorphisms. A special case of such categories is the category of connected components, for concurrent programs without loops.
